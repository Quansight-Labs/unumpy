.. note::
    If you are interested in writing backends or multimethods for ``unumpy``,
    please look at the documentation for :obj:`uarray`, which explains how to
    do this.

``unumpy`` is meant for two groups of individuals:

* Those who write array-like objects, like developers of Dask, Xnd, PyData/Sparse,
  CuPy, and others.
* Library authors or programmers that hope to target multiple array backends, listed
  above.

For example, the following is currently possible:

>>> import uarray as ua
>>> import unumpy as np
>>> import unumpy.dask_backend as dask_backend
>>> import unumpy.sparse_backend as sp_backend
>>> import sparse, dask.array as da
>>> def main():
...     x = np.zeros(5)
...     return np.exp(x)
>>> with ua.set_backend(dask_backend):
...     isinstance(main(), da.core.Array)
True
>>> with ua.set_backend(sp_backend):
...     isinstance(main(), sparse.SparseArray)
True

Now imagine some arbitrarily nested code, all for which the implementations can be
switched out using a simple context manager.

``unumpy`` is an in-progress mirror of the NumPy API which allows the user
to dynamically switch out the backend that is used. It also allows
auto-selection of the backend based on the arguments passed into a function. It does this by
defining a collection of :obj:`uarray` multimethods that support dispatch.
Although it currently provides a number of backends, the aspiration is that,
with time, these back-ends will move into the respective libraries and it will be possible
to use the library modules directly as backends.

Note that currently, only coverage is very incomplete. However, we have attempted
to provide at least one of each kind of object in ``unumpy`` for
reference. There are :obj:`ufunc` s and :obj:`ndarray` s,  which are classes,
methods on :obj:`ufunc` such as :obj:`__call__ <ufunc.__call__>`, and
:obj:`reduce <ufunc.reduce>` and also functions such as :obj:`sum`.

Where possible, we attempt to provide default implementations so that the whole API
does not have to be reimplemented, however, it might be useful to gain speed or to
re-implement it in terms of other functions which already exist in your library.

The idea is that once things are more mature, it will be possible to switch
out your backend with a simple import statement switch:

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np  # Old method
    import unumpy as np  # Once this project is mature

Currently, the following functions are supported:

* All NumPy `universal functions <https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/reference/ufuncs.html>`_.

  * :obj:`ufunc reductions <numpy.ufunc.reduce>`

For the full range of functions, use ``dir(unumpy)``.

You can use the :obj:`uarray.set_backend` decorator to set a backend and use the
desired backend. Note that not every backend supports every method. For example,
PyTorch does not have an exact :obj:`ufunc` equivalent, so we dispatch to actual
methods using a dictionary lookup. The following
backends are supported:

* :obj:`numpy_backend.NumPyBackend`
* :obj:`torch_backend.TorchBackend`
* :obj:`xnd_backend.XndBackend`
* :obj:`dask_backend.DaskBackend`
* :obj:`cupy_backend.CupyBackend`
* :obj:`sparse_backend.SparseBackend`
